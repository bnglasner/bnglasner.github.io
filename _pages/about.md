I’m Ben Glasner, a Senior Economist at the Economic Innovation Group. I work on questions at the intersection of labor markets, place, and social-policy design—especially where the economy fails to turn work into stability and upward mobility.

## Featured work

- **How to end low-wage work forever** — a wage-subsidy proposal aimed at raising take-home pay without discouraging employment.  
- **The Great Transfer-mation** — analysis of how many U.S. communities became more reliant on government-transfer income.  
- **Opportunity Zones & housing supply** — work on place-based policy and housing stock outcomes.

## What I work on

- **Wages, work, and labor-market institutions** (including wage-subsidy design)  
- **Economic geography and political economy** (place-based outcomes; geographic divides)  
- **Transfers, safety net programs, and poverty dynamics** (including intergenerational mobility and food assistance)  
- **Opportunity Zones and housing supply** (place-based policy evaluation, housing stock outcomes)  
- **Gig economy and the future of work** (my dissertation-era focus; policy implications)

## Background

I’m currently a **Senior Economist at the Economic Innovation Group (EIG)**. Previously, I was a **Postdoctoral Research Scientist** at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy, where I worked on policies affecting poverty and well-being, including the Child Tax Credit.

I earned my Ph.D. in Public Policy and Management from the University of Washington’s Daniel J. Evans School of Public Policy and Governance.
