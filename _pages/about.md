## Featured work

- **How to end low-wage work forever** — a wage-subsidy proposal aimed at raising low-wage work without discouraging employment.  
- **The Great Transfer-mation** — analysis of how many U.S. communities became more reliant on government-transfer income.  
- **Opportunity Zones & housing supply** — work on place-based policy and housing stock outcomes.

*(Next step: we’ll turn each of these into clickable items—either as Projects cards in `_projects/` or links to Publications / external pages.)*
